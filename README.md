Silver Jewelry Store - React + Bootstrap (Vite)

How to use:
1. unzip or clone the project
2. install deps: npm install
3. download images: ./scripts/download-assets.sh   (or manually add images to public/images/)
4. run dev server: npm run dev

Notes:
- I could not include Unsplash images directly in this ZIP due to environment network restrictions.
- The script scripts/download-assets.sh will fetch the images from Unsplash when run on your machine.
- Checkout is a demo form â€” no payment gateway integrated.
